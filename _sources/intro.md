# Welcome to the Open Image Data Handbook

```{warning}
This is very much a work in progress. There will likley be significant changes to both the structure and content in the coming weeks. Links should not be treated as stable.
```

## Objective
This book aims to collect best practices for working with and producing open image data and image analysis pipelines. This book focuses mostly on how to utilize open infrastructure and standards to work collaboratively with the broader image analysis community. This book does not aim to teach the fundamentals of image processing. If you would like to learn about the fundamentals of image processing, please see the ["Related books and resources section"](content:references:related_resources) below.

## Structure and usage
Currently this document is mostly a collection of thoughts. As more content is added, I will refactor into a more structured book. For now, the best place to start is the "data story".
