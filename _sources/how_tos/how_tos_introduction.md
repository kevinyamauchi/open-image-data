## Managing and installing python



## Packaging

Packaging is the process of making your software installable so that it can be distributed to users. When you have made a library or pipeline that you would like to share with the community, you will have to package it so that others can easily download and install it. Here, we will focus on python, as it is one of the most common languages for image processing and data science.  For more in-depth information, see the excellent [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/).
